You need to fix the following issues with the current implementation of the branch-searching functionality:

- The results should scroll if the number of results exceeds the result window
- There should be some UI component to highlight what the substring was; whether that be highlighting the substring in the results list, or showing it somewhere else in the UI
- If the user enters a substring that is not found, they are stuck on the TUI prompting them to enter a substring
